# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Getting back [Vuejs + GDrive](https://github.com/tralves/vue-gdrive) project going!
- Created [trello board](https://trello.com/b/wU4VFN4E/vue-gdrive-markdown-editor) and configured [pomello](http://pomelloapp.com/).
- Removing references to xgz. This was the file extension I picked when I wanted this project to be an exegesis tool. The first stage of this app, however, will be a collaborative markdown editor.
- Continuing converting from vuex1 to vuex2.

**Thoughts:** Trying to making some automated tests, but I can't call this TDD...

### Day 2: Jan 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Fixed [issue #6](https://github.com/tralves/raspi-soft-pwm/issues/6) in [raspi-soft-pwm](https://github.com/tralves/raspi-soft-pwm). Bumped lib version to 2.0.2.

### Day 3: Jan 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solving bug in JS testing where asserts in one test are being executed in another test.
Testing [Weex-Hakernews](https://github.com/weexteam/weex-hackernews). A Weex+Vue2 demo project!

**Thoughts** Testing JS is hard...

### Day 4: Jan 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Tests now work accordingly.

"Unforked" this project so editing this log counts as contributions. Yesterday I did relevant coding, but it did't count as contributions because I commited to a `dev` branch and to a forked project, which doesn't make the day green...

How to "unfork" a project:

1. `git clone --bare https://github.com/tralves/100-days-of-code`
2. Deleted original repository in https://github.com/tralves/100-days-of-code/settings.
3. `cd 100-days-of-code.git` and `git push --mirror https://github.com/tralves/100-days-of-code`

**Thoughts** Testing JS is still hard... There seems to be a lot of interest around Weex. I could make a small test app in Weex...

### Day 5: Jan 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished tests for CreateOpenFileDialog.js.

### Day 6: Jan 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Vuex2 in PageHeader.vue and App.vue. Change url on file create/load.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
